# 📚 Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) in Go

## 🧠 What is DIP?

**Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** is the **"D"** in the SOLID principles of software design.
It says:

> **"High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions."**

In simpler terms:

* Your **main business logic** (high-level) should not directly depend on **concrete implementations** (low-level).
* Instead, both should communicate through an **interface (abstraction)**.

This makes your code more **flexible**, **testable**, and **easy to change**.

## 📦 Real-Life Analogy

Imagine you’re buying groceries online:

* ❌ Bad: Your app can only use “Amazon Grocery” directly — if Amazon shuts down, your code breaks.
* ✅ Good: Your app talks to a “GroceryProvider” interface. Now you can plug in “Amazon”, “BigBasket”, or any other provider **without changing the core logic**.

## ⚙️ Example in Go

Here’s how we implement DIP in Go step-by-step:

---

### ❌ Without DIP (Tight Coupling)

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type MySQLDB struct{}

func (db MySQLDB) SaveOrder() {
    fmt.Println("Saving order to MySQL")
}

type OrderService struct {
    db MySQLDB
}

func (o OrderService) PlaceOrder() {
    // Directly depends on MySQLDB
    o.db.SaveOrder()
}

func main() {
    service := OrderService{db: MySQLDB{}}
    service.PlaceOrder()
}
```

**Problem:**

* `OrderService` is tightly bound to `MySQLDB`.
* If you switch to PostgreSQL, you must change the code inside `OrderService`.

---

### ✅ With DIP (Using an Interface)

We introduce an **abstraction** — the `Database` interface — so the service doesn’t care which database it uses.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// 🔌 Abstraction (Interface)
type Database interface {
    SaveOrder()
}

// 🗄️ Concrete Implementations
type MySQLDB struct{}
func (db MySQLDB) SaveOrder() {
    fmt.Println("Saving order to MySQL")
}

type PostgresDB struct{}
func (db PostgresDB) SaveOrder() {
    fmt.Println("Saving order to Postgres")
}

// 💼 High-Level Module
type OrderService struct {
    db Database // <-- depends on abstraction, not concrete type
}

func (o OrderService) PlaceOrder() {
    o.db.SaveOrder()
}

// 🚀 Usage
func main() {
    mysql := MySQLDB{}
    service := OrderService{db: mysql}
    service.PlaceOrder()

    postgres := PostgresDB{}
    service = OrderService{db: postgres}
    service.PlaceOrder()
}
```

✅ **Output:**

```
Saving order to MySQL
Saving order to Postgres
```

## 🧠 How It Works Under the Hood

When you assign a struct (like `MySQLDB{}`) to an interface (`Database`):

* Go stores two things internally:

  * `typeInfo` → Points to the type metadata and method table
  * `valuePtr` → Points to the actual struct value

At runtime, when you call `o.db.SaveOrder()`, Go:

1. Looks up the `SaveOrder` method in the **method table** (based on `typeInfo`)
2. Calls that method with the actual `valuePtr` as the receiver

Here’s a conceptual diagram:

```
+-----------------------------+
| OrderService (o)           |
|----------------------------|
| db: Database              |
|    +--------------------+ |
|    | typeInfo --------- |----> [MySQLDB type info + method table]
|    | valuePtr --------- |----> [MySQLDB{} in memory]
|    +--------------------+ |
+-----------------------------+

When o.db.SaveOrder() is called:
1️⃣ Look up SaveOrder in method table
2️⃣ Jump to function pointer (MySQLDB.SaveOrder)
3️⃣ Call function with valuePtr as receiver
```

This mechanism is what enables **polymorphism** in Go — the same method call runs different implementations based on the concrete type.

## ✅ Why DIP is Important

| Without DIP ❌                             | With DIP ✅                       |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| High-level code depends on concrete types | Depends only on interfaces       |
| Hard to change or replace implementations | Easy to swap implementations     |
| Not easily testable                       | Easy to mock and unit test       |
| Tight coupling                            | Loose coupling and better design |

---

## 🧪 Bonus: Easy Testing with DIP

Since `OrderService` depends on an interface, we can now **mock the database** for unit tests:

```go
type MockDB struct{}
func (m MockDB) SaveOrder() {
    fmt.Println("Mock saving order")
}

func main() {
    mock := MockDB{}
    service := OrderService{db: mock}
    service.PlaceOrder() // ✅ Output: Mock saving order
}
```

---

## 📌 Summary

* ✅ DIP is about **depending on abstractions, not concrete implementations**.
* ✅ It helps you write **loose, flexible, and testable** code.
* ✅ In Go, interfaces are the perfect way to implement DIP.
* ✅ Method calls are dynamically resolved at runtime via a **method table (itab)** and **value pointer**.

### 🧠 Final Tip

Think of **interfaces** as **contracts** — once your high-level code depends only on contracts, you’re free to change the underlying implementation anytime **without breaking anything**.

Would you like me to add a **real-world example** (like a payment gateway or email sender) using DIP too? (That’s the next great step to mastering this principle 💡)
